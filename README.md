# clicker_bot_game

This program is a little "bot" who plays to "https://www.tetralark.com/ClickerJs/". The script uses selenium (you can install it with <b>pip install selenium</b>). You have just to run the .py file and it will automatically play.

Make sure you have <b>chromedriver.exe</b> or change the code to the adapted browser.

It is not a very complicated program but it was cool to make it ! Have fun !

P-S : Sorry, no comment is the code.
